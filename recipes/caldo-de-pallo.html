            <p>
                This caldo de pollo turned out delicious on my first attempt! I like to serve this chicken vegetable soup with warm corn tortillas and a side of Spanish rice and refried beans.
            </p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <li>5 pounds chicken leg quarters</li>
                <li>2 gallons water</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>

                <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
                <li>4 large carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
                <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks</li>

                <li>1 chayote, cut into large chunks</li>
                <li>1 large white onion, cut into large chunks</li>
                <li>Â½ bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>

                <li>Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook until chicken meat falls off the bones, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Stir in chicken bouillon cube until dissolved; add carrots, potatoes, zucchini, chayote, and white onion. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until carrots and potatoes are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>

            </ol>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
                <p>The pot should be covered with a lid at all times when you are not adding ingredients.</p>
                <p>I didn't add much salt to the recipe, so feel free to add more to your liking.</p>
